ALWAYS KEEP THE EXE IN THE EXTRACTED FOLDER

If you have to move the exe at all, make sure to move config.ini too.
config.ini is the most important one, whilst help.txt can be discarded.
If the program can't detect help.txt it'll just link you to the Github page, but config.ini Must ALWAYS stay with the exe.

If you can, keep the exe in the extracted folder.
If you face any errors, report them to the GitHub page and they will hopefully be fixed.
