# Among Us Shortcuts
Formerly 'Seeker Kill', useful Keyboard Shortcuts to make the Among Us Experience Better

### DOWNLOAD THE .EXE, NOT THE .AHK - only download the ahk if you are a developer who wants to modify anything such as hotkeys etc

Whenever you use any of the **main** features within the script, a text will appear on the top right of the screen detailing which feature you are using.

### Anything with a '-HS' Sign next to it is For HIDE N SEEK!
### **NOTE** Most of these work best on Low Ping and may break if used on High Ping. If needed to, switch Among Us Servers to a region where you experience less Ping.

## -HS **Seeker Kill**
The Standard Kill. Every 100ms it presses Q.
Whilst all of these work best on low ping, Seeker Kill practically relies on Low Ping, as it struggles greatly on anything over 150ms
Activated by pressing **Ctrl F8**.

## -HS **Clicker Kill**
The Upgraded Kill. Every 50ms presses q, after 50ms presses the Kill Button.
The supreme kill, as it presses both the hotkey and the actual kill button
Moves Mouse to Kill Button
Activated by pressing **F8**

*Note:* If Flashlight Mode is on, Clicker Kill will restrict the flashlight to the bottom right of the screen, so the user will not be able to move the flashlight

## **Auto Public Private (Host)**
Utilising Among Us glitch for getting many people in lobby - by spamming the public / private button, it pushes your lobby to the top of the lobby list, making more people join
This works by moving your mouse to the Private / Public button's location and clicking every 1ms.
This can also be used as an auto clicker, but it will only move to that specific location.
Activated by pressing **F6**

## **Chat**
Simple shortcut for activating Chat
Activated by pressing **Ctrl T**

## **Admin Swipe**
By pressing a simple shortcut, you will automatically swipe the card perfectly each time
Once you press the hotkey **don't press any buttons or touch your mouse**
After it is over, feel free to continue.
Activated by pressing **Ctrl [**

## **Public Game**

Delays are a bit longer compared to other commands to take FPS into consideration
Immediately goes to Public Game List.
Activated by pressing **Ctrl P**

Leaves the game for you under half a second. Works wonders for quick escapes
Activated by pressing **Ctrl Q**
