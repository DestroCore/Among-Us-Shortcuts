# Seeker-Kill
A little script created for Among Us' Hide N Seek Gamemode, which if you are a seeker, will grant you the ability to quickly kill.

### DOWNLOAD THE .EXE, NOT THE .AHK - only download the ahk if you are a developer who wants to modify anything such as hotkeys etc

Whenever you use any of the **main** features within the script, a text will appear on the top right of the screen detailing which feature you are using.
