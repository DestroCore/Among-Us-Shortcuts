Seeker Kill:
- Presses 'Q' every 100ms. (can be changed in config.ini, 'killc')
- Relies on Low Ping
- Best solution if FlashLight mode is on
- CTRL F8


Clicker Kill:
- Presses 'Q' and clicks Kill Button on Screen every 100ms in total
- Perfect kill, as it presses button AND hotkey
- Basically Kill Aura
- Not Good For Flashlight mode, as you'll be permanently pointing towards the Kill Button
- F8


Auto Public Private (Host)
- Used by the Host
- Spams Public/Private button every 1ms
- Exploits glitch within Among Us, where spamming Public / Private will boost your lobby to the top of the lobbies list, making more people join
- Can be used as an auto clicker (but you can't choose where it'll click)
- F6


Chat
- Opens or Closes Chat and moves cursor to chat box
- CTRL T


Admin Swipe
- Moves card up and swipes it at the perfect speed
- Speed is selected from about 10 different speed choices, so this one is perfect
- This specific speed was tested over 10 times on The Skeld, is perfect each time
- 100% works on Skeld, if it doesn't work it's either lag or ping
- DON'T TOUCH YOUR MOUSE OR ANY BUTTONS - It will interrupt the process and give you a bad swipe
- CTRL SHIFT A


Public Game
- Presses Play -> Online -> Public Game
- Can be used on any of the screens (Play, Online, Public Game) - You can be on the screen with 'Create Game', 'Public Game', 'Join Game', and it will still work
- Quickly takes you to lobby list
- CTRL P


Menu
- Clicks Settings Icon to open up Settings
- Meant to emulate other games
- SHIFT ESC (Tried making it Esc, but many things in the game already rely on Esc, so it's been changed to Shift Esc)


Leave Game
- Immediately leaves game within the span of 200ms
- Works quickly and immediately
- CTRL Q


Sabotages (Skeld)
- Opens map, Selects Chosen Sabotage, Closes Map
- Only works on Skeld (Suited to Skeld's Map)
- Reactor - NUMPAD 1
- Lights - NUMPAD 2
- O2 - NUMPAD 3
- Comms - NUMPAD 4


=)
- Replaces '=)' with '=) It's kill or be killed after all'
- Just a fun little easter egg, and a reference to a little game
- =)



Editing The Config File
- You need to open the 'config.ini' file with a text editor
	- I'd recommend a program like Notepad or Notepad++. It's something simple
- For Most Hotkeys go to [GENERAL]. For Sabotages go to [SABOTAGES]. For the Kill Button go to [KILLBUTTON]

- Find the corresponding setting name (Full Names are at the bottom of the file)
- You'll see something like this:
	Skill=Shortcut
- Change whatever 'Shortcut' is to what you want it to be
- For specific things such as CTRL, or SHIFT, see below:
	- CTRL = ^ (e.g. CTRL A = ^a)
	- SHIFT = + (e.g. SHIFT A = +a)
	- ALT = ! (e.g. ALT A = !a)
	- WINDOWS KEY = # (e.g. WindowsKey A = #a)

- You can combine these as well
	- CTRL SHIFT = +^ (e.g. CTRL SHIFT A = +^a)

- After editing the config file, you must restart the program through CTRL F5
